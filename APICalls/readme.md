# Current Plan
*As of 1/23/25

* **Backend:**
    * Python script (generated by Claude) updates statistics regularly (daily or weekly).
    * Creates a CSV file containing the updated data.
* **Frontend (UI/UX):**
    * Designed and drafted.
    * Built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.
    * Features:
        * Player selection (individual or "select all").
        * Sorting options (alphabetical, ascending, descending).
        * Data visualization (bar graph).
        * Data display alongside the graph.
* **Development Process:**
    * Utilize AI assistance in frontend development.
    * Leverage developer skills (OOP, software development) to refine and maintain the project.

**In essence:** You plan to create a project that visualizes statistics. The backend will automatically update and generate data, while the frontend will provide an interactive interface for users to explore and analyze the data.
